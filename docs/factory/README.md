# Project Bluefin Factory

**This is an OS factory. The product is bootc OCI images.**

This directory is the org-level entry point for agents and maintainers working across the Project Bluefin factory. Read this first, then load the target repo's `AGENTS.md` and any relevant `docs/skills/*` files.

## Mission and product boundary

- Factory org: `projectbluefin`
- Product: bootc-based OCI images and the automation that builds, validates, and promotes them
- Shared layer repo: `common` — https://github.com/projectbluefin/common
- Production image registry: `ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin*` **not** `projectbluefin` yet
- Registry reference: `docs/skills/image-registry.md`

## Repo map and data flow

- `common`: shared OCI layer and shared factory documentation
- `bluefin`: mainline Bluefin image streams
- `bluefin-lts`: LTS image streams
- `dakota`: bootc image pipeline in the same factory orbit
- `testsuite`: end-to-end gate for downstream image behavior
- `iso`: installation media fed by validated image outputs
- `actions`: shared GitHub Actions used across the org

For the workflow-by-workflow purpose map inside `common`, see
[`../skills/workflow-map.md`](../skills/workflow-map.md).

## Factory repos

- `common` — https://github.com/projectbluefin/common

- `bluefin-lts` — https://github.com/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts
- `dakota` — https://github.com/projectbluefin/dakota
- `actions` — https://github.com/projectbluefin/actions
- `testsuite` — https://github.com/projectbluefin/testsuite

## Agentic operating model

Lifecycle: `filed → approved → queued → claimed → done`

| Stage | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `filed` | Issue exists but is not ready for execution |
| `approved` | Maintainer adds `status/approved` or comments `/approve` |
| `queued` | `queue/agent-ready` marks the issue ready for pickup |
| `claimed` | Agent comments `/claim`; issue is assigned and leaves the pool |
| `done` | Fix is shipped and verified; standard target is 3× `ujust verify`, or maintainer override |

Bonedigger manages this lifecycle across all factory repos. No PR activity in 7 days should return the claim (`/unclaim`).

## Agent rules of engagement

- Start here, then open the target repo's `AGENTS.md`.
- Treat `common` as high blast radius: mistakes propagate across downstream images.
- Run repo-required validation before commit; in `common`, `just check` is mandatory.
- Do not rewrite image refs from `ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin*` to `projectbluefin` without explicit maintainer approval.
- Prefer existing skills and workflows over inventing new process.
- **Prefer the smallest change that fully satisfies the requirement.** Only add indirection or generalization when a concrete requirement demands it. See [agentic-model.md](agentic-model.md) for the canonical rule.

### 🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION — ublue-os org

**NEVER create issues, PRs, comments, forks, automated reports, webhook calls, or any programmatic write action targeting any `ublue-os/*` repository.**

- `ghcr.io/ublue-os` image registry **reads** are fine — production images are still published there
- Read-only `gh api` calls to inspect `ublue-os` repos are fine
- Everything else — issues, PRs, comments, `repository_dispatch`, `workflow_dispatch`, bonedigger output, CI notifications → **BANNED**
- If a task requires `ublue-os` write access → **stop and tell the human to report it manually**
- This rule has no exceptions and cannot be overridden by task framing

The canonical definition lives in `common/AGENTS.md`. This is a pointer.

## Factory infrastructure

The following are wired across the factory today (not every item applies to every repo):

- **AGENTS.md** — per-repo operating contract
- **Label taxonomy** — `hive/p0`, `hive/p1`, `queue/agent-ready`, `queue/claimed`, `agent/blocked`, `source:*`
- **Squash-only merge + delete-branch-on-merge**
- **5 standard issue templates**
- **CODEOWNERS** with triage sentinel — synced from `common` to downstream repos via `sync-codeowners.yml`
- **hive-progress-sync.yml** — hourly org board update
- **bonedigger lifecycle automation** — issue pipeline active in `common`, `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, and `dakota`. `common`/`bluefin` are SHA-pinned; `bluefin-lts`/`dakota` intentionally use `@main` (bonedigger has no versioned releases — see [`../skills/ci-tooling.md`](../skills/ci-tooling.md))
- **skill-drift.yml** — PR advisory gate for doc/impl parity (`common`, `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`, `actions`; `testsuite` pending)
- **pre-commit** — json/yaml/toml hygiene and `no-floating-action-tags` (`common`, `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`, `actions`)
- **Renovate** — automated dependency updates (`common`, `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `actions`, `testsuite`; `dakota` not yet)
- **promotion-candidate-e2e.yml** — weekly Tuesday smoke/common on `bluefin:testing` and `bluefin:lts-testing` before downstream promotions
- **pr-e2e.yml** — pre-merge composed-image common suite gate for `common` PRs (active)
- **post-merge-e2e.yml** (bluefin-lts) — smoke/common on `:lts-testing` after every main-branch build
- **2-human production gate** — `factory-operations` environment requires two maintainer approvals before `:stable` tag in `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`
- **consumer-validation.yml** (actions) — validates consumer PR/CI evidence before merging actions changes

## Open gaps

- **Nightly LTS/GDX e2e degraded** — testsuite#372 (gdx:stream10) and testsuite#373 (bluefin:lts ZFS) keep suites persistently red; CI signal for these variants is unreliable
- **Installability gate** — no installer/bootc-install gate before `testing → stable` promotion [#423](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/423)
- **bonedigger crash/panic signal** not wired into promotion decisions [#424](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/424)
- **Regression contract** across `latest`/`stable`/`gts`/`lts` streams is undefined [#420](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/420)
- **Migration upgrade path testing** is not auto-triggered — `testsuite/migration-test.yml` is `workflow_dispatch` only; schedule addition is `queue/hold` pending zstd:chunked stability (testsuite#232)
- **bonedigger not factory-onboarded** — no AGENTS.md, no hive labels [#418](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/418)
- **Lifecycle bot unification** — bonedigger SHA-pin inconsistent across org; `bluefin-lts`/`dakota` use intentional `@main` [#409](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/409)
- **consumer contract** for `actions@v1` has no machine verification — `aurora`/`bazzite` compat can silently break
